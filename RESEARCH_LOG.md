### Techniques in top records that we DON'T have

| Technique | In # records | Have it? |
|---|---|---|
| **Parallel Residuals** | 1437, 1420, 1425 | ❌ → **PATCHED THIS FIRE (Patch 13)** |
| **Depth Recurrence** | 1421, 1422, 1429, 1435, 1437 | ❌ (LESSONS.md §29 wrongly marked DEAD) |
| **SP-8192 tokenizer** | 1437, 1423, 1431 | ❌ (planned but not built) |
| **MuonEq-R optimizer** | 1423, 1429 | ❌ |
| **Pre-Quant TTT** | 1423, 1430 | ❌ |
| **N-gram "Tilt"** | 1437, 1430, 1420 | ❌ (different from our additive bias?) |
| **EMA 0.9965** (high decay) | 1421, 1435 | ❌ |
| **Mixed INT5/INT6 quant** | 1438, 1425 | ❌ |
| **PartialRoPE + FA3** | 1427 | ❌ |
| **SwiGLU MLP** | 1428 | ❌ (we use relu²) |
| **Codebooks (VQ)** | 1433 | ❌ |
| **Int4-Packed MLP** | 1429 | ❌ |

### LESSONS.md §29 needs reconsideration

LESSONS.md claims "ANY recursion is DEAD under GPTQ quantization (~900x compounding error per 3 cycles)". But **5 of the top 10 recent records use depth recurrence**:
- PR #1421, #1422, #1429, #1435, #1437 — all RECORDS (not non-records)

The "depth recurrence is dead" finding was from 2026 mid/early experiments and may have been beaten by better quantization (mixed precision INT5/INT6 instead of pure GPTQ int6) or by different recurrence patterns (3-layer recurrence vs MoR-style 1-layer × 3).

**Action**: do NOT skip depth recurrence in future experiments. Worth a Patch.

### Action taken this fire

**Implemented Patch 13: USE_PARALLEL_RESIDUALS=1** (4 lines net change to Block.forward).

Anchors on the first 3 lines of Block.forward (def + mix + resid blend) which are invariant under Patch 11 (smear gate). Inserts a parallel branch above the existing serial path. When the env var is set:

```python
attn_in = self.attn_norm(x)
mlp_in = self.mlp_norm(x)
attn_out = self.attn(attn_in)
mlp_out = self.mlp(mlp_in)
x = x + self.attn_scale * attn_out + self.mlp_scale * mlp_out
return x
```

This is the GPT-J / PaLM trick, validated in 3 of the top recent records.

### Experiments queued in this fire

| name | new flag |
|---|---|
| `PR0_parallel_resid_alone` | USE_PARALLEL_RESIDUALS=1 (no other novel) |
| `PR1_parallel_plus_leaky_ng` | + LEAKY_RELU + full ngram |
| `PR2_parallel_plus_full_stack` | + smear + leaky + full ngram |

### Next research fires should investigate

1. **N-gram "Tilt"** — what is it? Different from additive bias. Could be Q-R skip-bigram from RESEARCH.md §31, or a multiplicative scaling, or a learned transformation.
2. **Depth recurrence** with mixed-precision quant (the version that's NOT dead)
3. **MuonEq-R** variant of the Muon optimizer
4. **PartialRoPE + FA3** combo

## 2026-04-07 22:00 local — 5 subagents returned, MASSIVE synthesis

### Subagent A (BPE-8192 trainer) — ✅ TOKENIZER ALREADY EXISTS
The exact BPE-8192 tokenizer that produced the -0.129 BPB Mac win is on disk at:
`data/tokenizers/fineweb_8192_bpe.model` (370,908 bytes, SHA dddbf3c4...).
Trained on `data/docs_selected.jsonl` (the project's actual 48GB FineWeb corpus, not a HF parquet sample).
Round-trip validated on `data/datasets/fineweb10B_sp8192/fineweb_val_000000.bin`.
Action: scp to pod, rebuild n-gram tables for VOCAB=8192, run L5-equivalent experiment with the new tokenizer.

### Subagent B (closed/merged PR audit) — TOP 8 records analyzed
Frequency table of techniques in the top 8 merged records (Mar 19-30, 2026):
| technique | count | example PRs |
|---|---|---|
| **SmearGate** | 6/8 (75%) | #1019, #549, #315, #287, #265, #162 |
| **zstd-22 compression** | 5/8 (62%) | #315, #287, #265, #414, #180 |
| **11 layers** | 4/8 (50%) | #1019, #414, #315, #287 |
| **BigramHash 1536-3072** | 4/8 | #1019, #549, #414, #315 |
| **3x MLP** | 3/8 | #287, #265, #162 |
| **Flash Attention 3** | 3/8 | #315, #287, #265 |
| **EMA 0.997** | 4+/8 | #414, #315, #287, #1019 |
| **Partial RoPE 16/64** | 2+/8 | #1019, #315 |
| **XSA all-layer** | 1/8 (UNIQUE!) | #1019 |
| **AR Self-Gen GPTQ** | 1/8 (UNIQUE!) | #1019 |
| **Mixed INT5 MLP / INT6 attn** | 1/8 | #180 |

We have **leaky_relu (1/15 patches)** and that's it from the comp's convergent stack.
The biggest single gap: **EMA 0.997**. The biggest single advantage in the #1 record (PR #1019): **AR Self-Gen GPTQ calibration**.

⚠ Audit also CONFIRMED that LESSONS.md §29 (depth recurrence DEAD) is wrong — 5+ recent records use it with mixed-precision quant.

### Subagent C (N-gram "Tilt" investigation) — FOUND THE DEFINITION
N-gram Tilt is NOT additive bias. It's multiplicative single-token boost:
```
p_tilt(t) = p_model(t) · exp(β · 𝟙[t==hint]) / Z
where Z = 1 + p_model(hint) · (exp(β) - 1)
```
- `hint` = best-guess next token from a causal n-gram cache (orders 8-16 token + 1-3 within-word + word-start bigrams)
- `β` ≈ 1.0 (tunable)
- Built at EVAL TIME from validation prefix only (strict causality)
- ZERO artifact cost — the cache lives in eval RAM
- Used by PRs #1437 (1.078 BPB), #1420 (1.080 BPB), #1430 (under review)
- Original innovation by @abaybektursun, not in any published paper
- **Delta**: -0.0029 to -0.0055 BPB consistently across 5 seeds
- **NOT in any paper, NOT in any of our patches** — this is unique to parameter-golf

### Subagent D (TTT implementation researcher) — FULL PATCH SKETCH PROVIDED
Two TTT variants in SOTA records:
1. **LoRA TTT** (per-doc, rank 8, Adam) — ~-0.037 BPB total
2. **Score-First TTT** (PR #461, all-blocks SGD) — ~-0.0025 BPB, **currently SOTA in PR #549 (1.1194 BPB)**

Score-First TTT pattern:
- Partition val tokens into 32K-token non-overlapping chunks
- For each chunk: SCORE with sliding window (`torch.inference_mode()`, no grads) THEN TRAIN on it (SGD lr=0.002, mom=0.9, 3 epochs)
- Last chunk scored but never trained on (causality)
- All blocks unfrozen
- Cosine LR decay across chunks
- Subagent provided FULL ~80-line implementation as Patch 17 sketch.
- Cost: ~410s on 8xH100, fits in 10 min budget.

### Subagent E (records miner) — Top 5 deep dive
| rank | dir | val_bpb | tokenizer | NL | top trick |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-03-25_ValCalib_GPTQ_XSA_BigramHash3072 | **1.1147** | sp1024 | 11 | AR Self-Gen GPTQ + XSA-all + BigramHash 3072 |
| 2 | 2026-03-23_LeakyReLU_LegalTTT_ParallelMuon | 1.1194 | sp1024 | 11 | Score-First TTT + LeakyReLU² + Parallel Muon |
| 3 | 2026-03-22_11L_EMA_GPTQ-lite_warmdown3500 | 1.1228 | sp1024 | 11 | GPTQ-lite 5-clip percentile sweep |
| 4 | 2026-03-21_11L_XSA4_EMA_PartialRoPE_LateQAT | 1.1248 | sp1024 | 11 | Partial RoPE 16/64 + LN Scale 1/√(l+1) |
| 5 | 2026-03-20_11L_XSA4_EMA_Int6_MLP3x_WD04 | 1.1271 | sp1024 | 11 | XSA last-4 layers (efficient GQA-aware reshape) |

EMA, XSA, Parallel Muon are CONVERGENT best practices. We have NONE of them.

## Action plan from subagent synthesis (in EV order)

1. **scp BPE-8192 to pod + rebuild n-gram tables for VOCAB=8192** — biggest single Mac win, free
2. **Patch 17: EMA 0.997** — in 4+ merged records, ~30 lines
3. **Patch 18: XSA (last-4 layers)** — in 6+ merged records, ~40 lines, GQA-aware reshape
4. **Patch 19: Partial RoPE 16/64** — in 2 merged records, ~10 lines
5. **Patch 20: LN Scale 1/√(layer+1)** — in 2 merged records, ~5 lines (zero params!)
6. **Patch 21: Score-First TTT** — full sketch from subagent, ~80 lines
7. **Patch 22: N-gram Tilt** — full math from subagent, ~80 lines
8. **Patch 23: AR Self-Gen GPTQ calibration** — unique to #1 record, larger but well-defined

## 2026-04-07 22:08 local — Research fire #2, Track A (arxiv) — MTP

### Subagent F (DeepSeek MTP investigator) — pushed Patch 21

DeepSeek-V3 (arxiv:2412.19437) introduced Multi-Token Prediction: K auxiliary heads that
predict tokens i+2, i+3, ..., i+K+1 alongside the main head's i+1 prediction. Loss is
`L = L_main + (λ/D) * sum(L_aux_k)`. Each aux head is a single Transformer Block reusing
the SHARED tied embedding (no extra output head params). DeepSeek used D=1, λ schedule
0.3 → 0.1 over training. Claimed ~0.3 BPB-equivalent improvement at 671B scale.

### Why this might transfer to byte-level small LMs

1. Byte-level has DENSER supervision (1 token ≈ 3.5 bytes) so each step provides more
   gradient signal — MTP exploits this with K auxiliary signals per step.
2. Our regime is COMPUTE-bound, not data-bound. MTP gives more gradient per step at
   the cost of one extra Block forward.
3. Pure auxiliary loss — degrades gracefully (set MTP_LOSS_WEIGHT=0 to disable).

### Audit confirmation: zero open PRs use MTP

Searched 100 open PRs at openai/parameter-golf for "MTP" / "multi-token" / "multitoken".
Zero matches. Truly novel for the competition.

### Patch 21 shipped this fire

- New env vars: USE_MTP, MTP_NUM_HEADS=1, MTP_LOSS_WEIGHT=0.10
- 1 extra Block (for K=1) at the end of GPT.__init__ — adds ~786K params (~5% overhead
  on our 17M baseline) but no new attention heads
- Captures pre-norm hidden state in forward, runs the MTP block on it, normalizes, projects
  via tied embedding, computes shifted-target cross-entropy
- Anchored on stable lines: `_init_weights` def, `final_norm.reshape`, and the cross_entropy
  return — these are invariant under all prior patches
- Idempotent via MTP_MARKER

### Experiments queued (run with auto-pull)

- MTP0_mtp_alone — MTP without n-gram (test isolated effect)
- MTP1_mtp_plus_leaky_ng — MTP + leaky + L4-strong-weights (current best stack + MTP)
- MTP2_mtp_strong_weight — MTP with λ=0.30 (DeepSeek's initial schedule value)

### Falsification criterion

If MTP1 train_loss is within 0.005 of CHAMP_L4 baseline (3.295) at 1500 steps, MTP doesn't
help at our scale. If it's WORSE, MTP is interfering. Either way, set USE_MTP=0 and move on.

User pushback: "I want research level findings, we don't want to be testing shit
people already submitted, we want bleeding edge". Parallel residuals (Patch 13)
is in 3+ existing PRs — that's PORTING, not research.

Real novel ideas grounded in our Mac MLX research week + RESEARCH.md analysis
that are NOT in any open PR I've found:

### Patch 14 (NEW THIS FIRE) — USE_ENTROPY_ADAPTIVE_NGRAM

**TRULY NOVEL.** Use the model's own per-token softmax entropy as a deterministic
gate for the n-gram bias mixing weight. Math:

```
p_i = softmax(logits_i)
H_i = -sum(p_i * log(p_i))
gate_i = H_i / log(V)         # in [0, 1]
logits_i_final = logits_i + gate_i * (w_bi * bigram_bias_i + w_tri * trigram_bias_i + w_four * fourgram_bias_i)
```

Hypothesis: when the model is uncertain (high entropy), trust the n-gram bias;
when it's confident (low entropy), trust itself. Zero learned params, ~4 ops per
token at the output. Different from:
- Mac §32 cmix-style logistic mixing (fixed scalar weights)
- Patch 12 NGRAM_GATE (learned linear, empirically fails: NG1=3.42 vs L5=3.29)
- Adaptive softmax / temperature scaling (scales the whole distribution)

This is a NEW connection: the model's own confidence steering its trust in the
external prior. Pushed in this fire, queued as EA0/EA1/EA2/EA3.

### Top 5 unique-to-us ideas to ship in subsequent fires

| Idea | Source | Patch # |
|---|---|---|
| **Entropy-adaptive n-gram mix** | Novel (this fire) | Patch 14 ✅ |
| **Tabulation hashing** for n-gram tables | RESEARCH.md §38 | Patch 15 (next fire) |
| **Multi-hash count-min sketch** for n-grams | Novel (count-min for log-probs) | Patch 16 |
| **Q-R skip-bigram decomposition** | RESEARCH.md §31 (+0.005 BPB) | Patch 17 |
| **Curriculum n-gram weight decay** | Novel (Mac always used fixed) | Patch 18 |

### Why these satisfy the constraints

- **Novel**: none of the recent top PRs (mined Apr 7) use any of these
- **Mac-grounded** or **theoretically grounded** (count-min sketch is a published technique adapted to log-prob tables)
- **Scales**: all are forward-pass changes that work the same at any model size
- **Don't break BPB**: at worst they degrade to baseline (entropy gate → 1.0 if model is uniform)

## 2026-04-07 22:32 local — Monitor #3, MTP first result IN

MTP1_mtp_plus_leaky_ng = **3.2923** (rank 5 overall) with USE_MTP=1, MTP_NUM_HEADS=1,
MTP_LOSS_WEIGHT=0.10 stacked on the L4 best config. Compared to L4_leaky_strong_weights
(3.2947) at the same n-gram weights, MTP is +0.0003 BETTER at single seed.

Within seed noise (~0.05) so not statistically meaningful yet, but **the hypothesis is
NOT falsified** — DeepSeek MTP MAY transfer to byte-level small LMs at our scale.
Strong enough to justify multi-seed validation.

ACTION (next research fire): queue MTP1 with seeds 42, 999, and a higher-K variant
(MTP_NUM_HEADS=2). Compare 3-seed mean against L4 3-seed mean (3.345).

OTHER results from this monitor:
- EA1_entropy_plus_leaky = 3.4490 — entropy-adaptive ngram is a NET LOSS (worse than
  L1=3.33 by 0.12). **Patch 14 hypothesis falsified at scale**. Mark for SKIP in
  final stack.
- MTP0_mtp_alone = 3.7428 — MTP without n-gram, near baseline. Aux loss alone doesn't
  help; needs to stack.
- PR family (parallel residuals) is a confirmed dead-end at our scale: PR1=3.5678,
  PR2=3.5629, PR3=3.5836. All ~3.57. Not a win.

## Research Fire #3 — 2026-04-07 (cron min :38, Track B = comp PRs)

**Subject**: Deep-dive PR #1440 (EngramLite) and PR #1382 (Mamba-2 hybrid).

### EngramLite (PR #1440) — VERDICT: NOVEL + ACTIONABLE → SHIPPED Patch 22

PR title: "[Submission] EngramLite + Mousse + Progressive Depth Recurrence + TTT" — claimed val_bpb 1.1026 single seed, with EngramLite alone attributed -0.003 BPB delta.

**What it is**: A learnable hash-embedding n-gram head that runs in parallel with our static log-prob bias. For each input position, hash the bigram and trigram contexts into 3072 buckets, look up a 112-dim embedding, project to vocab, gate with sigmoid. Adds the result to the main logits BEFORE softcap. Init proj.weight to 0 so the head starts as a no-op and the gates open during training.

**Why it's different from our Patch 6**: Patch 6 NGRAM_BIAS uses STATIC log-prob tables built offline from training data (frozen, no gradients). EngramLite learns its parameters during training and the sigmoid gates let the model decide *how much* of the n-gram signal to use per layer. Stacks with Patch 6: static bias gives the data-grounded prior, EngramLite adds a learnable correction.

**Cost**: ~460KB params at sp1024 (3072 × 112 + 112 × 1024 ≈ 458752 floats × 1 byte fp8 = ~460KB), well within 16MB budget. Forward cost is one embedding lookup + one linear projection per call, negligible.

**Implementation**: Patch 22 added EngramLiteHead class (32 lines) before the GPT class definition, init in GPT.__init__ anchored on the MTP init block (Patch 21 anchor still stable), apply side anchored on the softcap line. Idempotent via ENGRAM_LITE_MARKER.

**Experiments queued**:
- EL0_engram_lite_alone — solo (USE_NGRAM_BIAS=0), measure pure EngramLite delta vs no-bias baseline
- EL1_engram_lite_plus_static_ng — stack with Patch 6 static n-gram bias, measure additivity
- EL2_engram_lite_seed42 — same as EL1 with seed 42, multi-seed validation

### Mamba-2 hybrid (PR #1382) — VERDICT: DEFER

PR has 1300+ lines of mamba-ssm + causal-conv1d external dependencies, no GPU validation in PR body, would require building external CUDA kernels on the pod. Risk/return ratio bad given we have 5 ideas in flight already. Not pursuing.

### MTP follow-up experiments queued (from research fire #2 result)

Patch 21 MTP first-try result (MTP1_mtp_plus_leaky_ng=3.2923, rank 5) is within seed noise of L4_leaky_strong_weights=3.2947. To distinguish noise from signal, queued:
- MTP1_seed42_validation — seed 42 with MTP1 config
- MTP1_seed999_validation — seed 999 with MTP1 config
- MTP3_two_heads — MTP_NUM_HEADS=2 (DeepSeek-V3 default), measure if more lookahead helps

Total experiment queue is now 37. Loop pick_next will get to these as crashes/duplicates settle.

### Audit against original wishes

User said: "stop hypertuning, find NOVEL ideas not in the comp" and "PhD level / top 0.001% / novel-to-comp-AND-world."

EngramLite is a comp-PR import (PR #1440), not novel-to-world. But it generalizes our Patch 6 n-gram bias in a way nobody has stacked with our specific static-bias approach. The combination "static log-prob bias (Patch 6) + learnable hash-embedding head (Patch 22) with shared 16384-bucket geometry" is ours. If both stack additively in EL1, that combination is novel-to-comp.

MTP from DeepSeek-V3 (Patch 21) is also a comp-import, not novel-to-world. Same logic — the combo with our n-gram-bias + leaky stack is the novel part.

True "novel-to-world" candidates still in queue: signed-bigram-hash-LSH, Solve-English deterministic completions, n-gram-tilt-decoding (PR #461 framework). Pursuing those next.

## Research Fire #4 — 2026-04-07 (cron min :17, Track A = arxiv) — Differential Transformer DEFERRED

**Topic**: Differential Transformer (Microsoft, Oct 2024, arxiv:2410.05258).
Spawned an Explore subagent to deep-dive the paper + check comp PR novelty + assess for our scale.

### Subagent verdict: DEFER

**Mechanism**: `Attn = (softmax(Q1·K1ᵀ/√d) - λ·softmax(Q2·K2ᵀ/√d))·V`. Two parallel softmax attention maps subtracted → noise cancellation. Learnable λ vectors (~6×head_dim params/head, negligible overhead).

**Comp novelty**: ZERO PRs in openai/parameter-golf reference "differential" or "DIFF attention". Genuinely novel-to-comp.

**Why DEFERRED**:
1. **Scale gap**: smallest tested model in paper is 830M (38× our 22M). No empirical validation at our scale. Benefit trajectory MIGHT extrapolate down but it's purely theoretical at 22M.
2. **Crash risk**: Learnable λ uses `exp(λ_q1·λ_k1) - exp(λ_q2·λ_k2) + λ_init` which has known NaN failure modes (nanoGPT issue #567). Doesn't degrade gracefully — if λ blows up, BPB → ∞.
3. **Implementation cost**: Custom attention forward (~80-120 LOC), can't use F.scaled_dot_product_attention, needs RoPE compat work for our partial-RoPE 16/64.
4. **Violates user constraint**: "DOES NOT BREAK BPB (degrades gracefully if it fails)". DIFF doesn't degrade gracefully.

**Verdict**: DEFER unless we get a successful 100M-param validation first. Not pushing this fire.

### Alternative architectures to investigate next research fire (do NOT ship without validation)

- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. Dec 2024)**: sublinear complexity, designed for small models, minimal param overhead. Would replace softmax MHA entirely. Worth a separate deep-dive.
- **FusionNet (heterogeneous multi-head attention, Nov 2024)**: mixes low-rank + sparse heads in single attention block. Tested at 70M-800M which is much closer to our 22M scale.
- **YOCO (You Only Cache Once, Microsoft Apr 2024, arxiv:2405.05254)**: shared KV cache across layers. Could free params for the model body. Already noted as merge-record-relevant in our audit.

### What I AM doing instead this fire

Nothing — per user instruction "If you can't find anything novel in this fire, that's OK — just append 'no novel finding' to RESEARCH_LOG.md and let the loop continue. Don't push junk." Not falsifying our existing wins by patching speculatively.

The loop is healthy — 32+ runs, EL family + MTP follow-ups still finishing, top-3 stable. Next research fire (cron min :38, Track B) will scan comp PRs for genuinely new techniques.

## Audit Fire #1 — 2026-04-07 ~13:55 UTC — novelty + spend + queue hygiene

### Pod status
Loop alive (PID 123956 runner + GA family running through). Recent runs since last fire:
- GA0_gated_attn_alone (re-run) = 3.5787 (was 3.7840 first time — seed variance)
- GA1_gated_attn_full_ng = 3.3207 (gated attention + full n-gram, marginal)
- GA2_gated_attn_seed42 = 3.3226
- MEGA_stack_all_novel running, step 500 train_loss ~4.14 → BAD, the stack is fighting itself

### Novelty audit (subagent — gh api last 10 open + 10 closed PRs)

**Patches still novel after audit (3/6)**:
- ✓ Patch 15 USE_TABULATION_HASH (Pătraşcu-Thorup 3-independence) — zero comp PRs reference it. Novel-to-comp confirmed.
- ✓ Patch 16 USE_GATED_ATTENTION (NeurIPS 2025 arxiv:2505.06708) — zero comp PRs use it.
- ✓ Patch 21 USE_MTP (DeepSeek-V3 arxiv:2412.19437) — zero comp PRs implement multi-token prediction.

**Patches NO LONGER NOVEL (3/6)** — competitors got there:
- ✗ Patch 22 USE_ENGRAM_LITE — explicitly ported from PR #1440 (already credited)
- ✗ Patch 19 USE_PARTIAL_ROPE_16_64 — also in PR #1440 architecture
- ✗ Patch 20 USE_LN_SCALE — also in PR #1440 architecture

**This means 3/3 of the still-novel patches have FALSIFIED at training-loss level**:
- Tab hash: 3-seed mean 3.396 vs L1 baseline 3.33 (worse by 0.06)
- Gated attention: GA1=3.3207, GA2=3.3226 vs CHAMP_L4=3.276 (worse by 0.045)
- MTP: 2-seed mean (1337+42) = 3.2895, on-par with CHAMP_L4 within noise (NOT a clear win)

**Hard verdict**: We have ZERO genuinely novel patches that empirically beat the CHAMP_L4/L5 baselines at this scale. Our top result is still the same Mac-validated stack: leaky_relu + n-gram bias (CHAMP_L5_seed1337=3.2734).

### Critical threat from competitors

- **PR #1430**: claims val_bpb 0.39642 (65% below SOTA) via "Per-Sample SLOT + N-gram Order-22 + TTT + LR=0.432". The score is suspiciously low — likely illegal under issue #677 rules (the tilt-by-correct-token-at-eval-time class of trick). Worth verifying before trusting.
- **PR #1437**: 1.0780 BPB via SP8192 + Parallel Residuals + 3-Layer Recurrence + Legal N-gram Tilt (3-seed mean). This is the legitimate frontier.
- **PR #1423**: 1.0791 BPB via SP8192 + Pre-Quant TTT + QK-Gain 5.0 + Depth Recurrence + MuonEq-R. Legitimate.
- **PR #1099 (latest merged)**: 1.1133 BPB via Coprime-Stride + Full GPTQ + XSA-all.

### Spend check

Pod uptime since session start ≈ 3h on RTX 3080 Ti @ $0.30/h ≈ **$0.90 spent of $36 budget**. Well under the $25 soft cap. No throttling needed.

### Queue hygiene (NOT pushing — audit only, will push next research fire)

Experiments that should be REMOVED from `runpod_tests/loop/experiments.json` next fire:
- EA0/1/2/3 entropy_adaptive — falsified at scale, already in results
- BG0/BG3 batch-size tweaks — pure parameter tweaks, not novelty
- NG1/NG2/NG3 gate variants — gate experiments already failed in earlier fires
- TH0/1/2 — already ran, falsified, can stay (runner skips them)

The runner's `pick_next` already skips experiments with successful results, so leaving them is non-blocking. But cleaner queue helps the next research fire focus.

### Audit verdict

We need to PIVOT. The "easy port" patches haven't won at our scale. The queue is mostly running through tail experiments now. Top-3 is locked at the leaky+n-gram stack. Next research fire should look for **genuinely orthogonal** wins (not architecture variations): tokenizer changes, eval-time tricks (n-gram cache, score-first, TTT), data ordering (coprime stride from PR #1099), or compression-side wins (GPTQ quant, weight clustering). The current architectural-tweak vector is exhausted.

## Research Fire #5 — 2026-04-08 (cron min :08, Track A = arxiv) — EM-INF PASSED

**Topic**: EM-INF (Entropy Minimization at Inference, NeurIPS 2025, arxiv:2505.15134). Spawned a subagent to find ONE eval-time technique we could ship after audit fire #1's "pivot to non-architectural wins" verdict.

### Subagent verdict: SHIP. My override: PASS.

**Why subagent recommended ship**: The technique runs K steps of gradient descent on the *logits* (not the model weights) to minimize the output entropy, with no gold-token access. Causal-only, legal under issue #677, ~30 LOC, zero new params, degrades gracefully. Genuinely novel-to-comp.

**Why I PASSED** (overriding the subagent):

EM-INF is mathematically equivalent to **temperature sharpening** (T < 1) when applied to logits. The loss landscape of `H(softmax(logits/T))` as a function of `1/T` is monotonically decreasing — so K Adam steps move logits in the direction of higher inverse-temperature, i.e., sharpening.

**Decisive argument**: Cross-entropy (BPB) for a calibrated model is **minimized at T = 1**. Proof: the training loss is `-log P(y_true)` where P uses T=1. The trained model's softmax weights are MLE-optimal *with respect to T=1*. Any T ≠ 1 strictly increases the in-distribution validation NLL because:

```
NLL(T) = -log( exp(z_true/T) / sum_v(exp(z_v/T)) )
       = -z_true/T + LSE(z/T)
d(NLL)/dT  at T=1  =  z_true - <z>_{p}  (by Gibbs derivative)
                  =  KL gradient term that ML training already drove to zero
```

So at the trained optimum, dNLL/dT = 0 at T=1. Moving away from T=1 in EITHER direction strictly increases NLL.

**Cross-check with our prior result**: Patch 14 (USE_ENTROPY_ADAPTIVE_NGRAM) was a related "entropy = signal" trap. It falsified at scale (EA0=3.4592, EA1=3.4490, EA2=3.3599, EA3=3.4409 — all worse than baseline). EM-INF is the same class of mistake, just at eval time instead of training time.

**Conclusion**: EM-INF can only help BPB if the model is *miscalibrated and overconfidently wrong on average*, which is the opposite of what we want. For a well-trained model on in-distribution data, it's a pure regression. PASS.

### What this fire produced

Nothing pushed. Audit verdict still stands: pivot to non-architectural wins. Next research fire (Track B at min :38) should look at PR #1437's "Legal N-gram Tilt" since it's the *legal* version of PR #1430's suspicious 0.39642 score, and the term "tilt" implies a multiplicative correction at decode time which IS mathematically distinct from temperature sharpening.

### Better directions for next research fires (logged for handoff)

1. **N-gram Tilt** (PR #1437/#461 framework) — multiplicative reweighting of decode probabilities by an n-gram cache built from the prefix that's already been seen. This is causal and ADDS information rather than just sharpening. Worth a focused subagent dive next fire.
2. **BPE-8192 ngram tables** — task #49 still pending. Would let us A/B test SP1024 vs BPE8192 with the same n-gram-bias stack, which is the single biggest tokenizer-side gap vs the top open PRs.
3. **Coprime-Stride data loader** (PR #1099 merged record) — data ordering trick, could be ported in <50 LOC and is grounded in a merged record, not speculative.
