# Research Backlog — candidate pool for the stack-novelty campaign

**Day-1 seed: 30 candidates (3 per layer).** The C30 research cron appends more on every fire. The C5 monitor cron pops from the top of each layer's table when a pod's queue runs dry. Slot #3 in each layer is the world-novel seed.

See `STACK_NOVELTY_PLAN.md` for the per-layer hypothesis details and the world-novel justifications. This file is the **operational queue**, not the design doc.

Schema for every row:
```
| priority | name | source | hypothesis | expected_delta | novelty_estimate | code_skeleton_loc | added_utc |
```

`novelty_estimate` ∈ `world-novel-candidate` | `comp-novel` | `in-comp` | `unknown`. `code_skeleton_loc` is rough lines-of-code for implementation. `added_utc` is when the row was added (so we can age out stale candidates).

**Minimum backlog floor: every layer must have ≥5 untried candidates.** When a layer drops below 5, the next C30 fire prioritizes filling it (3 WebSearches + 1 GitHub search).

## Backlog hygiene rules

- C30 cron appends to the BOTTOM of each layer's table.
- C5 cron POPS from the TOP when a pod's queue is empty.
- When a candidate transitions to `screened-fail` in `STACK_NOVELTY_TRACKER.md` Section A, its row in this file should be removed (or moved to a `## Failed candidates` section at the bottom of the layer block).
- Manual user injection: just `git push` a row at the desired priority. The next C5 fire picks it up.
