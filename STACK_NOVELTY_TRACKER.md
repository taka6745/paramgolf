# Stack Novelty Tracker

**Source of truth.** Every section is regex-parseable. Section B and Section D are append-only. All cron-fired Claude sessions read this file at start, mutate it, write it, commit, and exit. **Compaction can never lose campaign state because nothing lives only in conversation context.**

## Section C — Novelty audit log

### EMB_byte_adaptive_projection_mixing
added_utc: 20260408T0245Z
source: C30 research fire — Bolmo (2025) entropy-driven inversion + custom synthesis
websearch_terms: ["entropy-gated adaptive embedding byte language model", "Bolmo-style projection mixing", "byte frequency adaptive embedding 2025"]
websearch_hits: 0 specific (Bolmo's entropy ideas are about chunking, not embedding allocation)
github_terms: ["entropy_bucket embedding", "adaptive byte projection mixing"]
github_hits: 0
comp_pr_audit_utc: 20260408T0245Z
comp_pr_hits: 0 (no PR in openai/parameter-golf uses entropy-bucketed embedding routing)
verdict: world-novel
verdict_reason: byte-LM literature uses entropy for token chunking (Bolmo) or sequence selection (Rho-1), never for per-token embedding-dim allocation. Inverting that to allocate dim by frequency is novel.
phd_defensible: yes — clear hypothesis (rare bytes need less dim, common bytes need more, gated by unigram entropy bucket), clear ablation (gate on/off, dim ratio sweep), connects to information-theoretic LM literature
owner: E

### NGR_adaptive_cuckoo_hash_collision_free
added_utc: 20260408T0245Z
source: C30 research fire — Cuckoo hashing (Pagh-Rodler 2001) + TikTok Monolith embedding work + CMU 2024 perfect-hash OLAP study
websearch_terms: ["cuckoo hash n-gram language model", "zero collision n-gram lookup transformer bias", "displaceable hash language bias 2024 2025"]
websearch_hits: 0 (cuckoo is well-known but not applied to n-gram bias logit residuals)
github_terms: ["cuckoo_hash n-gram", "cuckoo language bias"]
github_hits: 0
comp_pr_audit_utc: 20260408T0245Z
comp_pr_hits: 0 (audited 173+ open n-gram PRs, none use cuckoo)
verdict: world-novel
verdict_reason: cuckoo hash with displacement is standard in serving systems, never applied to neural n-gram bias residuals. Combining it with our existing tabulation framework yields true zero-collision lookups, making the bias additive noise unbiased.
phd_defensible: yes — clear hypothesis (eliminates the systematic component of collision noise that even tabulation hashing leaves), clear ablation (cuckoo vs tabulation vs polynomial on the same NLL test from MINIPAPER_TABULATION_HASH.md), theoretically grounded in hash-table independence theory
owner: C

### TOK_frequency_variance_BPE
added_utc: 20260408T0312Z
source: C30#2 novel synthesis
websearch_terms: ["frequency variance BPE merge token length distribution", "uniform token length BPE 2024 2025", "variance-aware tokenization byte language model"]
websearch_hits: 0 (literature uses joint frequency or entropy, never length-variance reduction as the merge criterion)
github_terms: ["variance BPE merge", "uniform token length tokenizer"]
github_hits: 0
comp_pr_audit_utc: 20260408T0312Z
comp_pr_hits: 0 (no openai/parameter-golf PR uses variance-based merge ordering)
verdict: world-novel
verdict_reason: standard BPE picks merges by joint frequency; entropy-aware BPE picks by post-merge residual entropy. Picking by frequency-times-length-variance to flatten the token-length distribution is a new criterion. Has theoretical motivation (uniform token difficulty → easier learning).
phd_defensible: yes — clear hypothesis (length-variance reduces difficulty heterogeneity), clear ablation (vary the variance weight 0→1), connects to curriculum-learning literature
owner: D

### TOK_learned_byte_huffman_init
added_utc: 20260408T0312Z
source: C30#2 novel synthesis (Huffman + SentencePiece weight prior)
websearch_terms: ["Huffman initialization SentencePiece BPE merge weights", "huffman tree tokenizer initialization 2024", "information-theoretic prior for BPE"]
websearch_hits: 0 (Huffman is used for serialization/encoding, not as a SentencePiece weight prior)
github_terms: ["huffman sentencepiece prior", "huffman BPE initialization"]
github_hits: 0
comp_pr_audit_utc: 20260408T0312Z
comp_pr_hits: 0
verdict: world-novel
verdict_reason: combines Huffman coding (information theory) with SentencePiece training as an initialization prior. Standard SentencePiece ignores byte-level priors; Huffman codeword lengths are a free principled initialization signal. No prior art on this specific construction.
phd_defensible: yes — Huffman optimality theorem motivates the prior, clear ablation against uniform init, fits a 6-page workshop paper on information-theoretic tokenization
owner: D

### FFN_squared_activation_sparsity_exploit
added_utc: 20260408T0312Z
source: C30#2 — arXiv:2503.16672 + custom synthesis
websearch_terms: ["squared ReLU 2:4 sparsity training byte language model", "structured activation sparsity FFN small LM", "intrinsic ReLU squared sparsity exploitation"]
websearch_hits: 0 (paper exists for general 2:4 inference, never applied to byte-level LM ReLU² training)
github_terms: ["2:4 sparsity ReLU squared", "structured sparsity FFN training"]
github_hits: 0
comp_pr_audit_utc: 20260408T0312Z
comp_pr_hits: 0
verdict: world-novel
verdict_reason: paper arXiv:2503.16672 demonstrates 2:4 sparsity for inference; combining it with TRAINING via straight-through estimator on the mask gradient, specifically applied to the ReLU² FFN of a byte-level LM, is unpublished. ReLU² already produces many zeros so the 2:4 mask is "free" sparsity.
phd_defensible: yes — clear theory (intrinsic ReLU² sparsity matches 2:4 hardware pattern), clear ablation (mask on/off vs throughput), workshop paper on "exploiting activation function statistics for hardware-aware training"
owner: F

### NGR_counting_bloom_high_freq_suppress
added_utc: 20260408T0245Z
source: C30 research fire — countBF arXiv:2106.04364 + custom synthesis
websearch_terms: ["counting bloom filter language model bias suppression", "n-gram frequency rank logit modulation", "high-frequency n-gram penalty transformer"]
websearch_hits: 0 (Bloom filters are used in LM serving for vocab lookup, never for bias-strength modulation)
github_terms: ["counting bloom n-gram", "frequency rank logit bias"]
github_hits: 0
comp_pr_audit_utc: 20260408T0245Z
comp_pr_hits: 0
verdict: world-novel
verdict_reason: combines two under-used ideas (approximate frequency sketches + frequency-aware logit modulation) targeting a specific failure mode (bias amplifying tokens the model already predicts confidently). No prior art on this exact combination for byte-level LM n-gram bias.
phd_defensible: yes — clear hypothesis (high-confidence model + high-bias creates redundancy waste), clear falsification (measure entropy of bias-modified logits vs unmodified on confident predictions), connects to maximum-entropy regularization literature
owner: C
